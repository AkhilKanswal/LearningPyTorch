**Machine Learning :**

*
    *It is the process by which a machine or a computer program/algorithm learns pattern from the data which is converted to set of numbers*

*  
    *Machine learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is the subset of Machine Learning*

##### **Reason of using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms :**

*
    *Helps in determining rules for solving complex problems*
*
    *They helps when we need to have large set of rules*
*
    *We'll use deep learning where the algorithm can adapt to changes as they are applied to continiously changing envirnoment*
*
    *Discovering insights within large data sets*

*
    
    **Google's number 1 rule for ML : <br> if you don't need it don't use it**


##### **Cons of using Deep Learning (typically)**

##

##### **video Timestamp :** **13:48 -16:50**


*
    *Deep Learning Models are non interpretable by humans*

*
    *Deep Learning Models are not used when we dont have adequate amount of data*


##### **Machine Learning vs Deep Learning**

*
    *Ml is used with structured data and Dl is used with unstructured data*

*
    *Algorithms for Ml:*<br>
    *1. Random Forest*<br>
    *2. Naive bias*<br>
    *3. Nearest Neighbour*<br>
    *4. Support Vector Machine*<br>

*
    *Algorithms for Dl:*<br>
    *1. Neural networks*<br>
    *2. Fast Forward Neural Network*<br>
    *3. Recurrent Neural Network*<br>
    *4. Convoulational Neural Network*<br>
